First task was to implement car class with gave requirements and error exception.

Second chapter include writing script for task management using argparse library.

In the last task  the code for finding possible password with passed restrictions was implemented.

Second task was a huge challenge for me,due to the lack of knowledge in using argparse library and console script programming.
