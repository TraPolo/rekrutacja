# Internship tasks

## General info
This project contains 3 tasks prepared for internship admission.
	
## Technologies
Project is created in Python 3.8 in PyCharm
	
## Content 
First task was the implementation of car class with given requirements and error exception.

Second chapter included writing script for task management using argparse library.
Script was testing in the command line. All tasks can be stored in the csv file.

In the last task  the code for finding possible password with passed restrictions was implemented.

## Feedback
According to my experience, solution for first and last task was more or less known for me.

Second task was a huge challenge for me,due to the lack of knowledge in using argparse library and console script programming.
